Session 01 - Types and Grammar 
+ Types are predicated upon the 'values' of a variable, not the variable! 
+ One should always do checks on variables to ensure that he is not populating his code with 'unused' variables. 
+ Rule thumb: Don't declare it if you are not going to use it! 
+ 'undefined' is a value 
+ There are 6 types: 
    + null
    + undefined
    + boolean 
    + number 
    + string
    + object 
    + symbol
